Hello,\n\n Welcome to our slack! Please be aware that *many users* will pretend to be part of the team and *will try to steal from you*. *DO NOT TRUST* anyone, especially <@USLACKBOT>. Slackbot is being used by scammers sending you "reminders" that look very convincing, so please, never trust anything coming from <@USLACKBOT>. Look at #announcements and #-scam-alert- when in doubt or ask other team members or admins.\n\n Again, welcome to our project and please stay paranoid!
