# antiScamBot_slack
antiScam-bot is a slack bot allowing admins to better control what is going in their slack channels and reduce potential scams, bad behaviours. The bot comes with a range of functions that admins can use to interact with the bot. The free slack API does not allow things like banning users and such, so more soft methods have been implemented for now. This bot is a work in progress and it is my hope that feedback and contributions will improve its reach. 

*Note that slack is not the best platform when it comes to security and I would advise using a platform like [Rocket Chat](https://rocket.chat/) (an opensource clone of slack), which has to be hosted locally, but allows you to fully define how the app behaves.*

## Installation

The bot was written in python 3.6 and has been written for Ubuntu 16. Contributions to make it platform independent are welcomed. 

**Python dependencies** ;
+ Python 3.6+
+ rtmbot
+ slack_client

### 1. Cloning the repository.
Please clone the repository on the machine you want to bot to run onto. I would recommend setting up a machine using Google cloud, Digital Ocean, or other cloud computing platform. This way, the bot would always be up and running without you having to worry about your computer shutting off (and it would allow you to have an Ubuntu 16 machine if you currently do not process one.
